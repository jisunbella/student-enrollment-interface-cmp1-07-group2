## overview
CLIUniApp is a Python command-line application developed as part of the Fundamentals of Software Development subject. It is designed to support student self-enrolment and administrative student management through separate, menu-based subsystems.
The Student System provides registration and login, followed by access to password management and subject enrolment services. The Admin System is designed to allow administrators to manage student records.
Student records are stored locally in `students.data` using JSON format, preserving student details and enrolment information between program sessions.

## Project Features 
The project scope includes:
- **Student registration:** Create an account with a name, university email address, and password.
- **Student login:** Verify login credentials against saved student records.

- **Subject enrolment:** Enrol in subjects (Max 4), remove subjects, and view enrolled subjects.
- **Administration:** Provide a separate menu for administrative functions.
